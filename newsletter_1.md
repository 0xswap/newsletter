# Newsletter #1

Welcome to the first newsletter from Security Without Borders. This is a somewhat regular newsletter covering recent cyber security issues, tools and events relevant for activists, dissidents, journalists and civil society at large.

> **Security Tip**: If you cross borders or you participate in protests, you might get your phone seized. You should use a strong  - at least 6-digits long - PIN code, and turn the phone off, especially if you use TouchID or other biometric locking. If you are compelled to unlock it, contact a lawyer.

This newsletter is an experiment. Please let us know if you enjoy it and suggest us any content you would like to see here either via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swborders) or via [email](mailto:info@securitywithoutborders.org).

## Security Alerts

In the month of January we have seen a good number of security vulnerabilities in prominent software. Here is a little recap, in case you are still behind on your software updates.

* **Wordpress**: Wordpress sites are constantly probed all sorts of attackers and are commonly compromised to serve malicious content. On January 10th, Wordpress released version 4.7.1 which is a *security release* intended to fix a number of vulnerabilities which have been discovered in the software and in some of its plugins (PHPMailer, particularly). If you use Wordpress, make sure you or whoever runs your website is informed and has updated the software. 

* **Firefox and Thunderbird**: In the last few days, Mozilla has issued security fixes for both [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2017-01/) and [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2017-03/). There are no public reports of these vulnerabilities being currently exploited by attackers, and normally both Firefox and Thunderbird should automatically download security updates. Just in case, make sure you're running the latest versions.

* **Apple**: In January Apple also released numerous security updates for their primary products, including [macOS Sierra](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222) as well as [iPhone iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207482), which saw the release of version 10.2.1. If you haven't done so already, make sure you have installed all the offered updates, as they fix critical vulnerabilities. For iPhones, you can do so through *Settings > General > Software Update*.

* **Flash Player and Adobe Reader**: In January Adobe has released multiple updates to fix critical vulnerabilities in Flash Player and Adobe Reader, including their browser plugins and extensions. Flash Player and Adobe Reader have become mostly superfluous with the progress of mainstream browsers (particularly Google Chrome, which to this day offers the better security protections) and with the advent of modern web technology. Quite frankly, we recommend uninstalling both.

## Cyberpolitics

* **China**: [China tightens its restrictions on VPN use by declaring unauthorized VPN services illegal] (http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2064587/chinas-move-clean-vpns-and-strengthen-great-firewall). According to BBC, [the block includes, among others, three popular VPN providers](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30982198) (Astrill, StrongVPN and Golden Frog). Major VPN providers are working on a solution. The ban continues until  March 31, 2018.

* **USA**: On January 25th, President Trump signed an executive order for ["Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united) that denies privacy protection to non-US citizens "to the extent consistent with applicable law" (Sec. 14). The concrete implications of this executive order and whether it affects the Privacy Shield agreement are still [a matter of debate](https://www.lawfareblog.com/interior-security-executive-order-privacy-act-and-privacy-shield).


## Informative Reading

* *Joshua Foust* published a good blog post detailing [how he successfully identified an attempted phishing attack](http://joshuafoust.com/how-to-spot-a-phishing-attack/). Phishing (an attack with the intent of stealing online credentials by mimicking login pages) remains one of the most common techniques employed by attackers all over the world. Using [two-factor-authentication](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication) and training an eye for recognizing these attacks, can go a very long way.

* An [extensive list of security ressources](https://medium.com/tinfoil-press/current-digital-security-resources-5c88ba40ce5c#.khzgl4l92) for journalist, lawyers, activists and other groups has been published at the beginning of the year. The list is quite extensive but if you are aiming at improving your security level you will certainly find helpful information there.
