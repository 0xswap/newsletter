# Newsletter #1

Welcome to the first newsletter from Security Without Borders. This is a somewhat regular newsletter covering recent cyber security issues, tools and events relevant for activists, dissidents, journalists and civil society at large.

> **Security Tip**: If you cross borders or you participate in protests, you might get your phone seized. You should use a strong  - at least 6-digits long - PIN code, and turn the phone off, especially if you use TouchID or other biometric locking. If you are compelled to unlock it, contact a lawyer.
